# Circus Video Archive - Project Proposal

## Executive Summary

The Circus Video Archive is a digital preservation platform designed to capture and celebrate the rich history of circus performances. Following the tornado disruption that caused significant institutional knowledge loss, this platform serves as a gift to the performer community - ensuring that decades of performances, techniques, and memories are preserved for future generations.

## The Problem

- Historical performance videos are scattered across personal YouTube channels
- Institutional knowledge was lost during the multi-year disruption
- No centralized way for alumni to share and discover performance history
- Risk of losing more content as time passes

## The Solution

A community-driven video archive that:

1. **Aggregates** existing YouTube videos into a searchable collection
2. **Preserves** metadata (year, act type, performers) alongside videos
3. **Connects** alumni through shared memories and performances
4. **Celebrates** the circus community's rich history

## Key Features

### V1 - Core Archive (MVP)
- YouTube video embedding
- Video submission form
- Browse by year and act type
- Basic search functionality

### V2 - Community Features
- Alumni authentication via email invite
- Performer identification/tagging
- Comments and discussions

### V3 - Recognition
- Community voting for best performances
- Annual "best of" collections
- Performance statistics
