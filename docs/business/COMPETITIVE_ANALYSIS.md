# FSU Flying High Circus Digital Presence: Competitive Analysis

*Research conducted: December 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

The FSU Flying High Circus has a fragmented digital presence with no centralized video archive. While preservation efforts exist (Oral History Project, university archives), they focus on audio, photos, and documents—not video. This creates a significant opportunity for a community-driven video archive platform.

## 1. Official Website (circus.fsu.edu)

### Current State

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Current operations, ticket sales, recruitment |
| **Video Content** | None embedded; social links in footer only |
| **Historical Content** | Minimal; About page mentions founding (1947) |
| **Archive/Browse Features** | None |
| **Alumni Engagement** | Not addressed |

### Key Findings

- **Homepage**: Focuses entirely on the circus's return to operations after tornado damage. Director Chad Mathews quote: "After a very long and challenging year without the big top tent, the circus prepares to return to full operations this fall."
- **About Us**: Mentions key milestones (founded 1947, recognition as "best in the world" 1981, CSTV documentary) but no systematic history
- **Performances Page**: Only lists future shows (Spring 2026, Halloween 2026). No way to browse past performances
- **Navigation**: Home, About Us, Join, Performances, Student Awards, Summer Camp, Contact Us

### Gaps Identified

1. No searchable performance archive
2. No video content on site
3. No historical timeline or browse functionality
4. No alumni engagement features
5. No way to discover past performers or acts

## 2. 75th Anniversary Page (circus.fsu.edu/75)

### Current State

The 75th anniversary (2022) spawned several preservation initiatives:

| Initiative | Description | Format |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| FSU Heritage Museum Exhibit | Images and artifacts at Dodd Hall | Physical exhibit |
| Oral History Project | Alumni interviews | Audio (MP3) |
| Museum of Fine Arts Exhibition | "Trust & Transformation at the Circus" | Art exhibit |
| VIRES Magazine Feature | Anniversary coverage | Print/digital |
| Partnership with The Ringling Museum | Collaboration on circus history | Institutional |

### Oral History Project Details

- **Format**: Audio only (MP3 files)

- **Sample content**: Clips like "Ace Carlson - Bonds", "Bob Dawson - Self Confidence"
- **Access**: Some clips on website, more in separate archive
- **Contact**: fsucircusalumni@gmail.com

### Gaps Identified

1. **Audio only** - no video component to capture visual artistry
2. **No performance footage** - stories without seeing the acts
3. **Limited accessibility** - audio format excludes visual learners
4. **No searchability** - can't find specific years, acts, or performers
5. **Volunteer-dependent** - great model but limited scope
