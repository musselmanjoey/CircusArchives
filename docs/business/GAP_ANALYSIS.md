# Gap Analysis: FSU Flying High Circus Digital Preservation

*Analysis based on competitive research conducted December 2025*

---

## Overview

This document identifies specific gaps in the FSU Flying High Circus's current digital presence and demonstrates how the Circus Video Archive addresses each one.

---

## Gap Matrix

| Current State | Gap | Impact | Our Solution |
|--------------|-----|--------|--------------|
| Oral History Project exists | Audio-only format | Visual artistry of circus not captured | Video archive with full performance recordings |
| Photos in university archives | Not easily accessible to alumni | 75+ years of photos locked in research systems | Community-driven platform with easy public access |
| No centralized video archive | Performance videos in personal collections | History scattered, at risk of loss | YouTube-based archive organized by year/act |
| 75+ years of history | Institutional knowledge lost after disruptions | New students can't learn from predecessors | Preserved, searchable knowledge base |
| Alumni website exists | Limited interactivity, no video | Alumni disconnected from history | Voting, comments, performer tagging |
| Social media active | Content not archived or searchable | Historical posts get buried | Permanent, organized archive |
| Anniversary initiatives launched | No sustainable video component | One-time efforts, not ongoing | Evergreen platform for continuous contribution |

## Detailed Gap Analysis

### Gap 1: No Video Archive

**Current State**
- Official website has zero embedded video
- One 8mm film from 1950s in university archives
- Performance videos exist only in personal collections
- YouTube has scattered, unorganized user uploads

**Impact**
- 75+ years of performances undocumented in video
- Visual artistry of circus acts cannot be appreciated
- Training techniques and evolution of acts lost
- New performers can't learn from historical performances

**Our Solution**
- Centralized YouTube-based video archive
- Organized by year, act, and performer
- Searchable database with rich metadata
- Permanent, accessible repository

---

### Gap 2: Audio-Only Oral Histories

**Current State**
- Oral History Project captures alumni stories as MP3 audio
- No visual component to interviews
- No performance footage accompanies stories
- Run entirely by volunteers

**Impact**
- Circus is inherently visual—audio alone insufficient
- Physical techniques can't be demonstrated
- Emotional impact of performances lost
- Accessibility limited for visual learners

**Our Solution**
- Video complements existing audio histories
- Performance footage paired with alumni stories
- Visual demonstration of techniques and evolution
- Multiple formats for different learning styles

---

### Gap 3: Scattered Archive Access

**Current State**
- Materials spread across 5+ systems:
  - FSU Digital Repository
  - FSU ArchivesSpace
  - Florida Memory (State Archives)
  - Alumni website
  - Social media platforms

**Impact**
- No single access point for alumni
- Research-grade access requirements
- Casual browsing nearly impossible
- Discovery by accident, not design

**Our Solution**
- Single, unified platform
- Public access—no research credentials needed
- Intuitive browse and search interface
- Designed for alumni, not archivists

---

### Gap 4: No Search or Browse by Performance

**Current State**
- Can't search: "1985 trapeze performances"
- Can't browse: "All juggling acts from 1990s"
- Can't find: "Videos featuring John Smith"
- No timeline view of circus history

**Impact**
- Alumni can't find their own performances
- Researchers can't trace act evolution
- Cross-generational connections impossible
- Discovery entirely manual

**Our Solution**
- Full-text search across all content
- Filter by: Year, Act Type, Performer, Show
- Browse by decade, act category, or performer
- Timeline visualization of circus history

---

### Gap 5: No Community Contribution Mechanism

**Current State**
- University archives accept donations (formal process)
- No way for alumni to easily upload videos
- No system for tagging or identifying performers
- Content contribution limited to insiders

**Impact**
- Valuable footage sitting in attics/basements
- Alumni can't contribute without institutional contact
- Performer identification relies on memory
- Community knowledge not captured

**Our Solution**
- Simple video submission via YouTube link
- Alumni can tag performers they recognize
- Community comments add context and stories
- Crowdsourced metadata enrichment

---

### Gap 6: No Recognition or Engagement Features

**Current State**
- No way to highlight outstanding performances
- No voting or recognition system
- Comments scattered across social platforms
- Alumni engagement passive, not active

**Impact**
- Excellence goes unrecognized
- No gamification to drive contribution
- Alumni memories not captured alongside videos
- Community building limited

**Our Solution**
- Voting system for best performances
- Leaderboards by year, act, performer
- Comments preserve stories and context
- Active community engagement

---

### Gap 7: Tornado Disruption Knowledge Loss

**Current State**
- May 2024 tornado destroyed Big Top
- Multi-year operational disruption
- Coach and performer transitions
- Institutional knowledge at risk

**Impact**
- Training continuity broken
- New students lack mentorship context
- Technical knowledge not preserved
- Cultural traditions at risk

**Our Solution**
- Video preserves techniques and training
- Historical performances serve as reference
- Alumni can mentor through shared videos
- Cultural continuity maintained digitally

## Priority Gaps for Proposal

When presenting to FSU Circus leadership, emphasize these three gaps:

### 1. Knowledge Preservation Crisis (Urgency)
> The tornado disruption combined with natural turnover means institutional knowledge is actively being lost. Every year without a video archive is more history gone forever.

### 2. Complementing the Oral History Project (Alignment)
> The volunteer-driven Oral History Project proves alumni want to preserve history. Video is the natural next step, using the same community-powered model.

### 3. Low Cost, High Value (Feasibility)
> YouTube hosts videos free. The platform is built. Alumni contribute content. This isn't a budget request—it's an adoption opportunity.

## Metrics to Track

Once launched, measure gap closure through:

| Metric | Current | Target (Year 1) |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Videos in archive | 0 | 100+ |
| Years represented | 0 | 30+ |
| Act types documented | 0 | 15+ |
| Alumni contributors | 0 | 50+ |
| Search queries/month | N/A | 500+ |
| Community votes cast | 0 | 1,000+ |

---

## Conclusion

The FSU Flying High Circus has rich history but fragmented, incomplete digital preservation. The gaps identified represent both risk (knowledge loss) and opportunity (alumni engagement, institutional differentiation).

The Circus Video Archive addresses every gap with a low-cost, community-driven solution that complements existing preservation efforts. The question isn't whether to preserve this history in video—it's how quickly we can start.

## Next Steps

1. Present gap analysis to circus leadership
2. Pilot with 10-20 videos from willing alumni
3. Demonstrate search and browse functionality
4. Gather feedback and iterate
5. Expand content collection systematically
