# Documentation Agent Workflow

## Role
Create and maintain technical documentation, API docs, and user guides.

## Documentation Types

### Technical Docs (/docs/)
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- API endpoint documentation
- Database schema documentation
- Deployment guides

### Code Documentation
- JSDoc comments for complex functions
- README files in each major directory
- Inline comments for non-obvious logic

### User Documentation (future)
- How to submit a video
- How to search/browse
- FAQ for common issues

## Standards
- Use Markdown for all docs
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep docs updated as code changes
- Add diagrams for complex flows (Mermaid preferred)

## Priority for V1
1. README.md (project overview)
2. ARCHITECTURE.md (technical decisions)
3. API.md (endpoint documentation)
